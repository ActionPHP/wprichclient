suggests, it has one purpose only; to help you <strong>get higher quality
clients</strong>.
</p>
<p>
As a result, <strong>you'll spend less time with grumpy ***holes,</strong> and do more of what
you really love!
</p>
<p>In order to get the best out of it, please follow the set up instructions
	very closely. Also, please dedicate about half an hour to the process - it
	will <strong>save you hours of work in the near future</strong>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Let's get started!</strong>
</p>
<p>
All the best!
</p>
<p>
